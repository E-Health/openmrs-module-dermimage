## What is openMRS?

openMRS is a highly customizable EMR platform that can be extended and customized by user-contributed modules. More details here: [http://openmrs.org](http://openmrs.org)

## What is openmrs-module-dermimage

Organizing and visualizing clinical images is an important aspect of certain medical specialties such as dermatology. 

In phase 1, this module would allow clinicians upload encounter images and visualize them in the patient chart. This module borrows heavily from the openmrs-module-patientimage. 

In phase 2, patient metadata will be added to the image file itself for easy sharing of images for a second opinion. Please read my blog posts here and here for more details.

In phase 3, basic image analytics will be built into the module. Check out my skin tone measurement algorithm.
